          One would think working in IT would make me a patient person. Today I found myself tired of waiting for the ConnectWise Automate agents to be deployed for a customer. Normally I push these agent-type installs using group policy which is fine in most cases.
While there are probably better deployment methods outside of what ConnectWise recommends I figured I&amp;rsquo;d put together a down and dirty script to speed things up for this particular install.
